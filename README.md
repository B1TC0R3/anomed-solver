# anomed-solver

Recursive solver for the board game [Anomed](https://anomed.de/anomed-brettspiel/).

This implementation uses a whole bunch of fancy formatting, so it may break in Windows terminals and
maybe even some Unix ones.

## Usage

```bash
python3 ./anomed_solver.py <red> <blue> <yellow> <black>
```
